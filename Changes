ToDo
        - XML::ESISParser: include Robert Braddock's update for OpenSP,

	- XML::Parser::PerlSAX doesn't pass ParseParamEnt to
	  XML::Parser, inspired by a request by Paul Mahoney
	  <ptm@xact.co.uk>

	  $self->{'has'}, suggested by Mike Richardson
	  <mike@quaking.demon.co.uk>
	- no modules are yet supporting SAX2
	- XML::Parser::PerlSAX doesn't implement ErrorHandler, it
	  should at least call fatal_error() if XML::Parser dies;
